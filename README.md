# Review Extraction API

This project implements a Review Extraction API that dynamically scrapes product reviews from any given product page, like Flipkart and Amazon etc. The API identifies dynamic CSS selectors for reviews using OpenAIâ€™s Large Language Model (LLM), interacts with the webpage via Selenium and Firefox browser automation, and handles pagination to retrieve all reviews. The extracted reviews are returned in a JSON format.

## Features

- Dynamic Review Scraping: Uses OpenAI's GPT model to dynamically identify the relevant CSS selectors for reviews on any product page.
- Browser Automation: Selenium with Firefox browser is employed to simulate browser activity and interact with the product pages.
- Pagination Handling: Automatically detects and handles pagination to extract reviews from all pages.
- Universal Compatibility: Works with any product page with reviews and ensures extraction of titles, body text, ratings, and reviewer names
